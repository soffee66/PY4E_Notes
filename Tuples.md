1. Tuples are another kind of sequence that functions much like a list, but immutable (similar to a string)
  - since it is immutable, certain functions do not apply
    - sorting, appending...etc
2. Tuples are more efficient, that is why we may prefer it over lists at times
  - such as when we are making temporary variables
3. Tuples are comparable
  - if we want to sort by *value* and NOT *key*, we use a for loop that creates a list of tuples
