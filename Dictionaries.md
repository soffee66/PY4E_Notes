# Chips
1. Lists are pringles
    - a linear collection of values with an order
2. Dictionaries are a bag of them
    - values, each with their own label (meaning no order)
*main difference: dictionaries uses keys instead of numbers to look up values*

# get()
1. used to provide a default value of zero when the key is not yet in the dictionary, and the just add one
    - meaning, if the key is not there the count is zero
*you can get a list of **keys**, **values**, or **items (both)** from a dictionary
